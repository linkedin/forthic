# README.md

The `v3` version of Forthic is meant to tighten up the language, the modules, and the conventions based on the learnings of a year of actively developing and managing roughly 300 Forthic apps at LinkedIn.

Many of the improvements are motivated by the success of applying ideas from Category Theory to Forthic development. This applies to both the language conventions and the Forthic modules.

Some of the improvements in the modules built on 3rd party APIs is to improve the fidelity of the module so that if the API allows something, so will the module. But at the same time, if an API does something inconsistent, we will try to correct it where possible in the Forthic module.

The overall aim is to simplify the Forthic language by making it more consistent and "categorical".
