!! Description:     Describes overall design of Forrthtran
!!

All constants should be defined in a constants.f90 file.

The Forrth state should be held in a Forrth object.

The Forrth state should be passed into every subroutine that works on Forrth.

When parameters are built up, we should use a linked list.

When a definition is done, we should allocate an array, copy the list, and free the list.

We need to implement a linked list type.

The linked list type will be used with the dictionary.

When we parse words out of the message buffer, we will use two integers (start and end).

This will be managed by a type called StringIndexes.
