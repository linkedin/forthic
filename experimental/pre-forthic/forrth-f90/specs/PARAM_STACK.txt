!! Description:     Describes how the parameter stack works
!!


ITEM MODULES

There will be an items module that contains arrays of every type of item that could be a parameter.
That includes entries.
An ItemArray type will maintain the current count and the max size of the array.
When the count == max size and another item is added, we double the size of the array.
We will have an array of ItemArray elements that are keyed by the ItemType.


ITEM POINTER

An ItemPointer will have the type of the item and its index into the ItemArray.
The ItemPointer will be defined in the forrth_types module.
All item types will also be defined in the forrth_types module.


ENTRY PARAMETERS, PARAMETER STACK, DICTIONARY

The parameters in an entry will be an array of ItemPointers.
The resize sequence for entry parameters is 0, 1, 5, then double each time
The elements of the parameter stack will also be ItemPointers.
The forrth dictionary would simply be an array of integer indcies into the entry array.
