FILES

CoreWords_.asm
	Adds ":", ";" words. Defines ExitDefinition, EndDefinition, StartDefinition, AddCoreWords
	Perhaps we could add another file called Definitions.asm?

Dictionary_.asm
	Defines FindEntry_ and MatchWord.
	Perhaps other functions could go here?

Error_.asm
	Defines UnknownWordError, ResetInterpreterState

forrth.cpp
	We may want to combine calls to StoreInput_ and ProcessInput_ into a generic Run_ function.

ForrthData_.asm
	Defines all of the global data
	We may want to move the comments to the public declarations and group them
	We may want to move all of the data so far into this file and initialize it in one place
	Lexicons would maintain their own data

Initialize_.asm
	Defines the Initialize_, AddStartEntry, and NOPEntry_
	We may want to move this to the Forrth data file

Literals_.asm
	Defines FindLiteralEntry_, PushIntegerPseudoRoutine
	We may want to move the routine and the entry to ForrthData

ProcessInput_.asm
	Defines ProcessInput_, Next_W_, GetNextWord_, Next_I_
	We may want to rename this to Engine.asm
	We may want to clean up some of the parsing.

StoreInput_.asm
	Defines StoreInput_
	We may want to move this to an Engine.asm

Constants.inc
	Defines constants

DictionaryMacros.inc
	Defines macros for interacting with dictionary
	Aside from a scrub, this seems to be fine

Entity.inc
	This is in good shape.


GENERAL THOUGHTS

We should remove the underscore from the filenames.
The trailing underscore is a good convention for public filenames.
We should do a general scrub of all files once the general rewrite lines are drawn. This will make things consistent.
We should keep on the lookout for macros that might clean up things (stack operations, entry addition)
