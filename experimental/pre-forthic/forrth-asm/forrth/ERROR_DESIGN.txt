;; Description:     Describes error handling
;;

One type of error is the invalid word.
If a word is not in the dictionary and cannot be parsed as a literal, it is an invalid word.
To handle an invalid word, we print the word and then reset the Forrth state.
During the next pass of the control loop, the next word will be read from input.


Another type of error is when something goes wrong with the execution of an instruction. 
We must check the result of executing an instruction and indicate what went wrong if possible.
After that, we reset the interpreter state.


RESETTING FORRTH STATE

To handle an invalid word, we print the word and then reset the parameter stack, return stack, instruction pointer, GetNextWord func ptr.
