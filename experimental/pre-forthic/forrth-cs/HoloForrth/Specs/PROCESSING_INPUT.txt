;; Description:     Describes how the input string is processed
;;

The first step is to break the input string into a linked list of words.
We'll use a regular expression to parse out the word and the rest of the string and loop until done.
Each word will be added to the end of a linked list.
When a word is executed, it may result in a nested execution.
In this case, words are added after the word that was executed and execution continues from there.
