A dictionary is a list of entries.

A dictionary is traversed from most recent addition to least.

An entry has the following form:

    -record(entry, {word, routine, parameters, immediate}).

A dictionary is a list of entries in a forrth record.

A forrth record has the following form:

    -record(forrth, {dictionary, stack, return_stack, compiling})

A forrth record is created on initialization. This also creates a dictionary.

The core words are added during initialization.

There is a function called find_entry that searches a forrth dictionary for a word.

We use undefined to indicate that an entry could not be found.
