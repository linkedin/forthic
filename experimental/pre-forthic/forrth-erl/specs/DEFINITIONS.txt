%% Description:     Describes implementation of definitions
%%

A definition is started with the { : } word. 

This creates a new entry and puts the forrth interpreter into compiling mode.

The routine associated with this entry is execute_definition

Any entries are compiled into the parameters of the current entry

If an entry is immediate, it is executed right away.

A definition is ended with the { ; } word.

This compiles an exit_definition_entry into the current entry and clears compiling mode.


Executing a definition pushes the current instruction pointer onto the return stack.

This also sets the execution mode to "execute definition".

The instruction pointer is then set to 0.

In the main loop, we get the next instruction entry instead of finding it.

The exit_definition_entry pops the previous instruction pointer.

If the return stack is empty, it switches back to normal execution mode.
