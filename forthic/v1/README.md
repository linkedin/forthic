# Where's Forthic v1?

The first version of Forthic was created to make an internal LinkedIn web app easier to configure
for project management tooling. Forthic v1 code could only be revised within that web app and so
it was never open sourced. The first version of Forthic to be open sourced was technically `v2`.
