# README.md

The `forthic` directory holds the Python version of the Forthic interpreter. It really should be
named `forthic-py` to follow the other directory names (`forthic-js` and `forthic-react`), but since
it came first (and since this repo is ostensibly for a Python library), it gets to be called "forthic".
